# Fuel Cell Performance Prediction

# Overview
This project predicts the performance of fuel cells using various machine learning models. Multiple regression models were compared to determine the best-performing algorithm.

## Dataset
The dataset contains performance data of fuel cells, with the target variable being Target5.

The dataset has been split into 70% training (700 samples) and 30% testing (300 samples).

## Here are the performance results of some models:

Extra Forest Regressor achieved the highest R² score (0.7724) and lowest RMSE (20.7101), making it the best-performing model.

Gradient Boosting Regressor followed closely with an R² score of 0.762 and RMSE of 21.0466.

Linear Regression scored decently but was less accurate.

Decision Tree Regressor underperformed.

Passive Aggressive Regressor (PAR) performed poorly with a negative R² score.
